REGROWTH - defines regrowth rate of vegetation, values from 0 to 10
	   with value 0 being fastest and value 10 being slowest

LIFESPAN - defines lifespan of bugs, must be value larger than 10

MIGRATION - defines grazer migration pressure, values from 0 to 10

"-" = water
" " = barren land
"." = some vegetation
"*" = dense vegetation
"o" = small grazer
